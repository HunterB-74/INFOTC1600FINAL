# Welcome to the tutorial
## If you have not already, make sure you have downloaded and installed VMware Workstation which can be found [here.](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro.html)
## Make sure as well that you have downloaded the .iso file for the latest version of Ubuntu Desktop which can be found [here.](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)

If you have both of these downloaded then proceed with the tutorial.

First start by opening VMware Workstation and locating the file option in the upper left hand corner and click on it.

The next section will have to specify the maximum ammout of allowed storage space for the machine on your hard drive as well as if you want the files split or not.
Unless you are doing something that requires either of these to be changed leave them on the reccomended values.

From here it will automatically power on the machine and begin the installation of Ubuntu.
Follow along with the Ubuntu Installer until it is finished.
Once installation is complete the final thing to do is make a snapshot of the virtual machine that it can be rolled back to incase of any problems.
To do this navigate to the left hand side of the screen to the library and right click on the virtual machine.
