# Welcome to the tutorial
## If you have not already, make sure you have downloaded and installed VMware Workstation which can be found [here.](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro.html)
## Make sure as well that you have downloaded the .iso file for the latest version of Ubuntu Desktop which can be found [here.](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)

If you have both of these downloaded then proceed with the tutorial.

First start by opening VMware Workstation and locating the file option in the upper left hand corner and click on it.

Unless you are doing something that requires either of these to be changed leave them on the reccomended values.
